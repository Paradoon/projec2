<h2>About</h2>
Maze game built with javascript in 2D. You are the darkgrey ball that needs to get to the blue portal to get to next level, using keyarrows on keyboard for desktop and keyarrows on display for mobile-versions. There are three levels that needs to be completed before the time runs out to complete the game. You are competing against the time, like everything in life.

<h3>Content</h3>
The content is inspired by my life experiences and discoveries, by time, and by my nephew. I focused on how to touch the player and to give the feeling of stress and dedication rather than design, since in the end, it's a simple game.
